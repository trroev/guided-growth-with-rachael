          Change. One of the few absolute truths in life. Therapy
          offers a chance to facilitate growth, a deeper understanding
          of oneself, a richer connection to others, and the discovery
          of more meaning in your life, while experiencing the
          inevitable changes life gives us. Big, small, and
          in-between. So often humans resist change which can lead to
          distress and overwhelm. If we shift our perspective,
          external changes (and changes within us for that matter),
          can be a fountain of opportunity for growth and finding
          deeper meaning in our lives. Let me be your guide as you
          navigate the inevitable challenges life throws our way, and
          help you transform those challenges into personal growth!
        </p>
        <p className="pb-6">
          I work with people to identify what personal growth,
          changes, and shifts they need to live a more fulfilling,
          satisfactory, and meaningful life - and then partner with
          them to achieve it. I have and continue to seek training in
          the most up-to-date evidence based treatments, although I do
          not subscribe to any one modality of treatment. Instead, I
          use a variety of skills and interventions based on each
          person&#39;s unique needs and goals for treatment. So
          whether you&#39;re wanting someone to vent your day to day
          stressors to or if you need support in overcoming anxiety,
          depression, or another significant mental health concern, I
          have the expertise to support you through it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I firmly believe for therapy to be effective for anyone, it
          has to start with trust and a meaningful relationship
          between a therapist and the person seeking treatment. Not
          every therapist is the right fit for you! I encourage and
          welcome people to continue seeking a therapist that they
          feel connected to - even if it may not be me. Research
          supports that people will best achieve their goals in
          therapy predicated on having a therapist who they feel like
          “gets them.”
