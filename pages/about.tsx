            I am a licensed clinical social worker with 13 years
            experience in the mental health field. I graduated from
            Grand Valley State University in 2010 with my Bachelor in
            Social Work. Following graduation, I worked for two years
            gaining social work experience by working at a homeless
            youth shelter (The Bridge, Arbor Circle), providing case
            management services to families with children who had
            disabilities, and then providing case management services
            for adults with significant mental illness (Bipolar
            disorder, Schizophrenia) and intellectual disabilities.
            Following these experiences, I went to graduate school at
            Western Michigan University and graduated in 2013 with my
            Master&#39;s Degree in Social Work (MSW) and earned my
            SPADA graduate certificate (Speciality Program in Alcohol
            and Drug Abuse). With my Master&#39;s degree, I ventured
            into therapy via a home based therapist position serving
            children, adolescents, and their families. My family and I
            relocated to California where I continued to gain
            experience in crisis interventions and stabilization
            serving children and families as well as adults
            reintegrating into the community from locked facilities. I
            then transitioned to a role of providing therapy to youth
            in the foster care system and processing trauma they had
            endured. I took a break from therapy, and pursued
            experience in medical social work by working for a
            community hospital. Eventually, I returned to my
            heart&#39;s calling of offering therapy to children,
            teens, families and parents. Most recently I worked for a
            telehealth private practice group providing care to
            children, teens, families and adults. Throughout the years
            I had aspired to open my own practice and here we are.

            My broad experience with a variety of different people and
            in different settings have shaped me to be a deeply
            empathetic, non-judgemental, and skilled therapist. I am a
            balance of nurturing and compassionate with directness and
            honest reflections of what you bring to the therapy space.
            I am an LGBTQIA affirming, social justice aligned, and
            climate change aware therapist - all of these world issues
            impact our day to day living and can exacerbate anxiety
            and mood concerns. I&#39;m a safe person to discuss these
            concerns with.

            I am currently providing tele-health appointments to
            residents in Michigan, California, and Massachusetts (CA
            LCSW #73823, MI LMSW # 6801110065, MA LICSW # 124554).
            I&#39;m so glad you found me and I look forward to the
            opportunity of supporting you through whatever concerns
            have brought you here!
