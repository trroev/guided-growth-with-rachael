            <p className="text-sm md:text-justify">
              This varies from person to person, and mostly depends on
              what you&#39;re hoping therapy will help you with!
              During our first 1-3 appointments we will be exploring
              and agreeing on therapy goals to focus on together.
              Based on your goals, we can discuss an estimated
              timeline of treatment for your own unique needs.

              My rate is $175 per 50 minute session. If you&#39;re
              interested in family therapy, these appointments are a
              full 60 minutes and are $210 per session.

              Not currently. I am considered an out-of-network
              provider. However, through Mentaya we can use your
              health insurance plan information to obtain an accurate
              estimate of how much your insurance will likely
              reimburse you (no guarantees due to variability of
              insurance plans, but helpful to have an estimate!).
              Mentaya also will automatically submit claims on your
              behalf (saving you the hassle of submitting superbills)
              and whatever reimbursement you&#39;re eligible for will
              be mailed directly to you. If you have further questions
              about this service, please reach out!

            </div>
            <p className="text-sm md:text-justify">
              Superbills are an invoice including information about
              services you receive by me for your insurance to be able
              to reimburse you. They include dates, service type
              (therapy code for insurance), length of session, amount
              paid by you, and a diagnosis code so that your insurance
              carrier receives all the information they need to
              reimburse some of the cost to you.

              something you&#39;re interested in when reaching out to
              start therapy so we can plan for in person services!

              Simple Practice is how we complete initial paperwork to
              get started, schedule appointments, and host our
              teletherapy video appointments. I chose Simple Practice
              for its reputation of being HIPAA compliantâ€”meaning it
              is a secure platform that protects your confidentiality,
              data, and privacy as well as making it as easy as
              possible for both myself and you to schedule
              appointments! You can join from the computer using the
              appointment link that is emailed to you, or, if
              you&#39;re using a tablet/ipad or phone, you&#39;ll need
              to download the free Simple Practice App!
