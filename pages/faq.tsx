              My rate is $165 per 50 minute session. If you&#39;re
              interested in family therapy, these appointments are a

              This varies from person to person, and mostly depends on
              what you&#39;re hoping therapy will help you with!
              During our first 1-3 appointments we will be exploring
              and agreeing on therapy goals to focus on together.
              Based on your goals, we can discuss an estimated
              timeline of treatment for your own unique needs.

              Not Currently. I am considered an out-of-network

              Superbills are an invoice including information about
              services you receive by me for your insurance to be able
              to reimburse you. They include dates, service type
              (therapy code for insurance), length of session, amount
              paid by you, and a diagnosis code so that your insurance
              carrier receives all the information they need to
              reimburse some of the cost to you.

              Simple Practice is how we have our video appointments,
              complete initial paperwork to get started, schedule
              appointments, submit payments for your appointments and
              receive your superbill invoices. I chose Simple Practice
              for its reputation of being HIPAA compliantâ€”meaning it
              is a secure platform that protects your confidentiality,
              data, and privacy as well as making it as easy as
              possible for both myself and clients to schedule and
              have appointments! You can join from the computer using
              the appointment link that is emailed to you, or if
              you&#39;re using a tablet/ipad or phone, you&#39;ll need
              to download the free Simple Practice App!
